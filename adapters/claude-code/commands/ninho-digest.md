# Weekly Digest

Generate a summary of the week's decisions, completed requirements, and learnings.

## Instructions

1. **Determine date range**:
   - Default: last 7 days
   - Optional: specify `--week YYYY-WW` for a specific week

2. **Gather data from**:
   - `.ninho/prds/*.md` - decisions and completed requirements
   - `~/.ninho/daily/*.md` - learnings
   - `.ninho/pr-mappings.json` - merged PRs

3. **Extract by date**:
   - Decisions: from Decision tables (look for dates in range)
   - Completed requirements: from Session Log entries
   - Learnings: from daily files in range

4. **Generate markdown summary**

## Output Format

```
# Week of 2026-02-10

## Decisions Made (5)

### Auth System
- **Use JWT tokens** - Stateless, scales horizontally (Feb 12)
- **24h token expiry** - Balance security vs UX (Feb 14)

### API Integration
- **REST over GraphQL** - Simpler for MVP (Feb 11)
- **Pagination with cursors** - Better for large datasets (Feb 13)

### User Dashboard
- **Tailwind CSS** - Faster development (Feb 10)

## Learnings (7)

### Corrections

### Decisions

- Prefer composition over inheritance (Feb 13)

### Notes
